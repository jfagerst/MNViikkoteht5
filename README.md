### Body mass index using ViewModel

Implement Android app with Kotlin and Compose, which calculates body mass index based on person’s height and weight. Formula for calculating bmi is weight / (height * height). In this exercise a ViewModel class should be used to hold all necessary information (member variables) and operations (methods). 

Some advice:
- Use walkthroughs/exercises implemented earlier as a reference (e.g. Bmi, Viewmodel)
- Create separate class file for ViewModel
- Remember to add required library for viewmodel to build.gradle and sync it
- Add member variables (states) for data that is asked from the user
- Add member variable for result (bmi) and implement get property which returns bmi (this could be done differently as well)
